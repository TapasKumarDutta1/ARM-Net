## Useage
- Clone the repository, and download the weights of the trained model, put them into 'weights-cdanet' folder, you can run test.py to test the model directly. 

- If you want to train the model, download the dataset

- Run the following code: python train.py Note that parameters and paths should be set beforehand

- To test your model, run test.py once your training is complete. Execute python test.py once training is complete.
